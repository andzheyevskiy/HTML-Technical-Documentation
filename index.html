<section id="What_is_HTML?" class="main-section"><header><h1>What is HTML?</h1></header>
<p>In this article, we cover the absolute basics of HTML. To get you started, this article defines elements, attributes, and all the other important terms you may have heard. It also explains where these fit into HTML. You will learn how HTML elements are structured, how a typical HTML page is structured, and other important basic language features. Along the way, there will be an opportunity to play with HTML too!</p>
<p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on. For example, consider the following line of text:</p>
<pre>My cat is very grumpy</pre>
<p>If we wanted the text to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in a paragraph (<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>) element:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;</code> My cat is very grumpy <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<div class="note">
    Note: Tags in HTML are not case-sensitive. This means they can be written in uppercase or lowercase. For example, a <code>&lt;</code>title> tag could be written as <code>&lt;</code>title>, <code>&lt;</code>TITLE>, <code>&lt;</code>Title>, <code>&lt;</code>TiTlE>, etc., and it will work. However, it is best practice to write all tags in lowercase for consistency and readability.

<section id="Anatomy_of_an_HTML_element" class="main-section"><header><h1>Anatomy of an HTML element</h1></header>
    <p>Let's further explore our paragraph element from the previous section:</p>
    <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started/grumpy-cat-small.png" alt="HTML Analisis imnage">
    <p>The anatomy of our element is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="bold">The opening tag: </span>This consists of the name of the element (in this example, p for paragraph), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This opening tag marks where the element begins or starts to take effect. In this example, it precedes the start of the paragraph text.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">The content: </span>This is the content of the element. In this example, it is the paragraph text.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">The closing tag: </span>This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This marks where the element ends. Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error that can produce peculiar results.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The element is the opening tag, followed by content, followed by the closing tag.</p>
</section>

            <!-- ========================================================================== -->

<section id="Nesting_elements" class="main-section"><header><h1>Nesting elements</h1></header>
    <p>Elements can be placed within other elements. This is called nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word very in a <code>&lt;</code>strong> element, which means that the word is to have strong(er) text formatting:</p>
    <pre> <code>&lt;</code>p>My cat is <code>&lt;</code>strong>very<code>&lt;</code>/strong> grumpy.<code>&lt;</code>/p> </pre>
    <p>There is a right and wrong way to do nesting. In the example above, we opened the p element first, then opened the strong element. For proper nesting, we should close the strong element first, before closing the p.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The following is an example of the wrong way to do nesting:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;</code>p>My cat is <code>&lt;</code>strong>very grumpy.<code>&lt;</code>/p><code>&lt;</code>/strong></pre>
    <p>The <span class="bold"> tags have to open and close in a way that they are inside or outside one another. </span>With the kind of overlap in the example above, the browser has to guess at your intent. This kind of guessing can result in unexpected results.</p>
</section>

            <!-- ========================================================================== -->

<section id="Void_elements" class="main-section"><header><h1>Void elements</h1></header>
<p>Not all elements follow the pattern of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. Some elements consist of a single tag, which is typically used to insert/embed something in the document. Such elements are called void elements. For example, the <code>&lt;</code>img> element embeds an image file onto a page:</p>
<pre>
    <code>&lt;</code>img <br>
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/beginner-html-site/gh-pages/images/firefox-icon.png" <br>
  alt="Firefox icon" />
</pre>
<p>This would output the following:</p>
<img
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/beginner-html-site/gh-pages/images/firefox-icon.png"
  alt="Firefox icon" />
</section>

            <!-- ========================================================================== -->

<section id="Attributes" class="main-section"><header><h1>Attributes</h1></header>
<p>Elements can also have attributes. Attributes look like this:</p>
<img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png" alt="Atributes example">
<p>Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content. In this example, the class attribute is an identifying name used to target the element with style information.</p>
<br>
<p>An attribute should have:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A space between it and the element name. (For an element with more than one attribute, the attributes should be separated by spaces too.)</li>
    <li>The attribute name, followed by an equal sign.</li>
    <li>An attribute value, wrapped with opening and closing quote marks.</li>
</ul>
